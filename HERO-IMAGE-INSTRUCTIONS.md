# Hero Background Image

To add a hero background image:

1. **Get a beautiful backyard/landscape photo**
   - Use one from DBM's Instagram
   - Or use a stock photo from:
     - Unsplash.com
     - Pexels.com
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080px or larger

2. **Save the image**
   - Name it: `hero-backyard.jpg`
   - Place it in the `dbm-landscape` folder (same location as index.html)

3. **The CSS is already set up!**
   - The hero section in `styles.css` already references `hero-backyard.jpg`
   - Once you add the file, it will automatically display

**Current State:**
- Without the image: Green gradient background (fallback)
- With the image: Beautiful backyard photo with dark overlay

The dark overlay ensures text remains readable over any background image.
